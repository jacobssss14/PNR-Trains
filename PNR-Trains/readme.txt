This is the PNR Trains NewGRF for OpenTTD written in NML. 



----------------------
2 Usage and Parameters
----------------------

There are currently no special parameters included with the GRF.

----------------------
2.1 Usage Notes
----------------------

The trains are built to run on narrow guage tracks. It is highly recommended to use a NewGRF that provides 
narrow guage railtypes. We recommend the Japan Set Tracks and set the Mode from the parmeters to international.

----------------------
3 Version scheme
----------------------
As of 0.10.3, the naming scheme is as follows:

 *The first decimal  (release) denotes the release version. 0 idicates pre-releases betas
 *The second decimal (version) denotes an addition of a train model or 10 consecutive minor code changes and bug fixes
 *The third decimal  (revision/alpha) signifies one of the following
    -Single digit    (revision): Minor code changes and/or bug fixes. 10 of these changes will raise the digit on the secod decimal by 1
    -Two or more digits(alpha): Alpha versions meant for testing of new features or trains
  
Example
0.10.3 is read as pre-release version 10, revision 3
0.10.21 is read as pre-release version 10, alpha 21
