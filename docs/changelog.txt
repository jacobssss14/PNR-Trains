Changelog for PNR-Trains
1.1.0
    It has come to our attention that the running costs and purchase cost of trains in this set
    are too low. Good for early game but allows AIs to become a little too aggressive. In line of
    this, the following changes were made:
        *Rebase multiple support files
        *New calculations for MU coaches
        *Re-introduced varied cargo age period 
        *Narrow guage trains are up to 20% less costly to operate than standard-guage ones 
        

    New Features
        *Added parameters for purchase cost, running cost, and loading speed adjusment
        *Added wagon attachment limitations
        *Added NSCR Airport Express EMU
        *Added new livery for EM10000
